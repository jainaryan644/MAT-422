        "2. **Second-Order Necessary Condition:** If x* is a local minimizer and f is twice differentiable at x*, then the Hessian matrix of f at x* must be positive semi-definite. This ensures that the function is locally curved upwards around x*.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Second-Order Sufficient Condition:** If the gradient of f at x* is zero and the Hessian matrix of f at x* is positive definite, then x* is a strict local minimizer. This provides a stronger condition for identifying a local minimum, guaranteeing that f(x*) is strictly less than f(x) in the neighborhood.\n",
